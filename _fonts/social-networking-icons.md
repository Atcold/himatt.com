Back in mid-2011 I was working on a website that required some links to social network pages, and struggled to find a set of flat, uniform vector website icons that I could use readily for any application. I decided that it would be useful to collect them into a portable and well supported formatâ€”a font.

I released a trial version a month later which received over 150,000 downloads in less than half a year. I then went on to create a refined commercial version which has proven to be popular; it has been used by over 100 companies, studios and designers worldwide on both the web and in print, including the largest digital font vendor [Myfonts](www.myfonts.com). The latest version of Social Networking Icons (3.0), now includes 158 individual icons in 6 different styles.
